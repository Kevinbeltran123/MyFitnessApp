## 📋 **Implementation Guidelines for LLM:**

### 🎯 **Focus Areas:**
1. **User Value First:** Every task should provide immediate value to fitness users
2. **Data Persistence:** Ensure nothing gets lost when the app restarts
3. **Simple UI:** Clean, straightforward interfaces over complex animations
4. **Form Validation:** Prevent users from entering invalid data

### 🛠️ **Technical Constraints:**
- **Use existing architecture:** Build on current Riverpod + clean architecture
- **Reuse components:** Leverage existing widgets like `ExerciseSearchBar`
- **Keep it simple:** Avoid over-engineering; focus on working features
- **Test as you go:** Add basic tests for each completed feature

### 📱 **UI/UX Principles:**
- **Material 3 Design:** Consistent with existing app styling
- **Responsive:** Work well on different screen sizes  
- **Accessible:** Proper contrast, touch targets, screen reader support
- **Fast:** Minimize loading times, use local storage efficiently

## 🔄 **Next Steps After Completion:**

Once Phase 1 is solid, consider these Phase 2 enhancements:
1. Improved charts and visualizations
2. Exercise progress tracking
3. Workout streak counters
4. Basic workout insights

**Note:** Advanced analytics (Phase 3) should only be considered after the core experience is stable and user-tested.
